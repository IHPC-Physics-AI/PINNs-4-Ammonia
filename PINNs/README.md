# Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for the Ammonia Cracking Reaction

## Introduction

This set of code contains PINNs that solve for Temperature and / or NH3 Concentration at steady state. The remaining Species Concentrations can be determined using stoichiometry. The code was written with ```JAX``` and ```Flax```, and incorporates the ```Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse``` into its network architecture.

As mentioned in the ```data_generation``` folder, the overall equation is given by the convection-diffusion of the chemicals and temperature.
``` math
\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial t}=D_a \frac{\partial^2 Y_i}{\partial x^2} - \frac{u_g}{A_c} \frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial x} + R_i(Y,T,x) 
```
``` math
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=\frac{\lambda}{C_{pg}(Y,T)} \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} - \frac{u_g}{A_c} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + R_T(Y,T,x) 
```

The initial and boundary conditions follow those in the ```jax_data_generation``` folder and can be found there.

## Organisation of Folder

This folder can be further divided into three segments:
- Single Variable PINNs (PINNs that solve exclusively for Temperature or NH3 Concentration only)
- Multi Variable PINNs (PINNs that solve for both Temperature and NH3 Concentration)
- Data of Species Concentrations and Tempertures at steady state (Obtained from code in ```data_generation```)

The remainder of this ```README.md``` will be dedicated to an overview of the PINNs and key concepts crucial to their function, as well as a brief description of the dataset used and its creation.

## Network Architecture

The x-coordinates are taken as inputs and fed into 3-4 hidden layers. The nodes of the final hidden layer is then utilised in the formation of the pseudoinverse $Ax = b$. To summarise, the time-derivatives in the governring PDEs are set to 0, and the reaction terms (independent of the variables) are brought over to the RHS of the equation.

The dependent variable can be obtained by $Y = \sum w_i f_i$ (where $f_i$ is the value of the $i^{th}$ node and $w_i$ is the associated weight obtained from the psuedoinverse), and its derivatives can be obtained by $\frac{dY}{dx} = \sum w_i \frac{df}{dx}$ and $\frac{d^2Y}{dx^2} = \sum w_i \frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$ (where $\frac{df}{dx}$ and $\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$ can be obtained with auto-differentiation).

The coefficients of the PDEs can be obtained either through 

## Dataset

```steady_state_solution.npy``` contains data generated by the solver in ```jax_data_generation```. In this instance, 1001 discrete spatial points were

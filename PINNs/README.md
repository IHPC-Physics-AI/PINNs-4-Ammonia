# Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for the Ammonia Cracking Reaction

## Introduction

This set of code contains PINNs that solve for Temperature and / or NH3 Concentration at steady state. The remaining Species Concentrations can be determined using stoichiometry. The code was written with ```JAX``` and ```Flax```, and incorporates the ```Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse``` into its network architecture.

As mentioned in the ```data_generation``` folder, the overall equation is given by the convection-diffusion of the chemicals and temperature.
``` math
\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial t}=D_a \frac{\partial^2 Y_i}{\partial x^2} - \frac{u_g}{A_c} \frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial x} + R_i(Y,T,x) 
```
``` math
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=\frac{\lambda}{C_{pg}(Y,T)} \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} - \frac{u_g}{A_c} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + R_T(Y,T,x) 
```

The initial and boundary conditions follow those in the ```jax_data_generation``` folder and can be found there.

## Organisation of Folder

This folder can be further divided into three segments:
- Single Variable PINNs (PINNs that solve exclusively for Temperature or NH3 Concentration only)
- Multi Variable PINNs (PINNs that solve for both Temperature and NH3 Concentration)
- Data of Species Concentrations and Tempertures at steady state (Obtained from code in ```data_generation```)

The remainder of this ```README.md``` will be dedicated to an overview of the PINNs and key concepts crucial to their function, as well as a brief description of the dataset used and its creation.

## Network Architecture

## Dataset

```steady_state_solution.npy``` contains data generated by the solver in ```jax_data_generation```. In this instance, 1001 discrete spatial points were
